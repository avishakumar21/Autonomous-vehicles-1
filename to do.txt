1.Want each vehicle to be aware of whose next to it and be able to look thru
a global list of vehicles, but only the vehicles in range. This would involve accessing
the global list of vehicles, might want to change that to a hashset in order to do quicker 
lookup

2. Focus on safety lane change, get results from that and write up about optimization stuff
in the extend works for the paper

3. After hitting a certain threshold, want to then perform a lane change after checking to
see if it's clear. Want to go to a lane in order to get back up into max speed

Vehicles: 0 to 6 m.s^2 acceleration
Pedestrian: 0 to 3.5 m.s^2 acceleration
Implement a random vehicle speed that varies by about +- 10 in speed limit, whatever range tbd

Tyler needs: collisions, acceleration/velocity/position of every vehicle at a time for each
time step

CCAT Robot:
Want to deduce a material selection, want to select a material thats as light as possible
and decide why. Then figure out how to actually make the thing depending on what material
was picked. Add feet to the robot cover to attach nuts and bolts.
